            <h3>Cheryl Chen</h3>
            <p>Cheryl is a systems thinker, connector, and tactical strategist with over 13+ years of experience in cultivating teams and utilizing technology to disrupt systems and empower communities. A trained human geographer at heart - people have always been at the center of her work. Cheryl’s expertise is in building for-purpose organizations from the ground up that challenge ‘business as usual’ systems both in how they operate and in the impact they seek to create. She was previously the Operations Director and Seafood Traceability Technology Pod Manager with Future of Fish--an international NGO focused on ending overfishing by developing strategic and investable triple bottom line seafood supply chain innovations in under-served coastal communities worldwide. Before then she was with Point 97 and Ecotrust where she designed and orchestrated large-scale multi-stakeholder initiatives centered on the development and implementation of fisheries/ocean management and seafood supply chain technology solutions. Cheryl received her Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
